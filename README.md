# Pr√ºfungsanmeldesystem
This is a project for our school. The name is German and means "exam login system". 

# Code Style
Everything is in English, except the name!

The programming language is PHP. For debugging we use a ubuntu virtual machine. 

# Connect to Server
The virtual machine we have can be reached by 
the name "ems". The name should be automatically 
resolved if you are in the same network.

To test it type "http://ems/index.html" in the browser.

# Test Access
```bash
ssh wolli@ems
cisco

su
